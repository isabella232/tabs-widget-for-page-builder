Adds a "Tabs for Page Builder" widget, which can be used in Page Builder by SiteOrigin editor.

== Description ==

Page Builder by SiteOrigin editor is great, but it lacks a "tabs widget", so we created one.

The "Tabs for Page Builder" widget allows you to add multiple tabs with a tab name and tab content. The tab content is using the Page Builder editor, so you can build your own layout inside the tab content (add widgets, set columns, ...).

The front-end display is the same as the tabs in Bootstrap framework.

[More details about this plugin can be found in this post](http://gregorcapuder.com/tabs-widget-for-page-builder/).

Note: This widget works only in the Page Builder editor, so do not use it in the WordPress sidebars.

Note: the front-end design is "bare bones", so only the default Bootstrap CSS is used. So you should style it to your own liking with custom CSS. Maybe we will add some custom skins in the future, but I can't make any promises.

== Installation ==

Upload the Tabs Widget for Page Builder plugin to your WordPress site, Activate it, and that's it.

Once you activate it, the "Tabs Widget for Page Builder" widget will be available in your Page Builder editor.
